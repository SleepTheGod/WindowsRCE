Windows RCE Proof of Concept
Overview
This repository contains a proof of concept script for demonstrating Remote Code Execution (RCE) capabilities on Windows systems using WebAssembly. The script, main.py, automates the setup and execution of a WebAssembly module built from C++ code.

Features
Automated Setup: Installs necessary Python packages and Emscripten toolchain.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on Windows and Unix-like systems.
C++ to WebAssembly Compilation: Compiles C++ code to WebAssembly and integrates it with a web server.
HTTP Server: Serves the compiled WebAssembly module and HTML file.
Files
main.py: The main Python script that handles the entire process.
module.cpp: C++ source file to be compiled to WebAssembly.
module.wasm: Compiled WebAssembly module (generated by the script).
module.js: JavaScript file to interact with the WebAssembly module (generated by the script).
index.html: HTML file to load and run the WebAssembly module (generated by the script).
Installation
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/SleepTheGod/WindowsRCE.git cd WindowsRCE

Run the Script

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Run the main.py script to start the setup process:

python main.py

The script will:

Install necessary Python packages.
Install and set up the Emscripten toolchain.
Compile the C++ code to WebAssembly.
Generate the required HTML and JavaScript files.
Start an HTTP server to serve the files.
Usage
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see the WebAssembly module in action.
Check the browser console for WebAssembly output.
